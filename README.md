# Apollo GraphQL Tutorial Notes

Project has 2 parts:

1. server
2. client

## Starting server for local development

`cd server`
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

This will start the server in PORT 4000 by default.

## Starting client for local development

`cd client`
`npm i`
`npm run dev`

This will start the client dev server in POST 5173 by default.
